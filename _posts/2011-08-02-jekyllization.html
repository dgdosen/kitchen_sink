I've been reading about Jekyll (on github) and it looks like a much more desirable way to host a website and related blog than wordpress.  And for the most part - it's written in Ruby and supports MarsEdit.  

It's so easy - it looks like stealing candy from a  baby! - What a lark, let's try!

This post is going to my wordpress blog, let's see how long it takes me to move it to Jekyll on github (not including DNS changes).

See you on the flip side.
